## Automated stage-discharge-relationships out of DGPS and drone-crosssections in an alpine river
This project is part of my master thesis about "Discharge measurements in alpine rivers - Opportunities of numeric hydraulic stage-discharge-relationships".  
If you want a more detailed insight of the project, you will find a PDF ("") in my project folder.
