## Automated stage-discharge-relationships out of DGPS and drone-crosssections in an alpine river
This project is part of my master thesis about "Discharge measurements in alpine rivers - Opportunities of numeric hydraulic stage-discharge-relationships".  
If you want a more detailed insight of the project, you will find a PDF ("") in my project folder.

## Goal of the script
The goal of this python script is to create a stage-discharge relationship out of a measured river crosssection.

## Investigation Area
My area of intrest concerning four rivers in the region of Susten and Grimsel. They were:
  - Steinwasser
  - Giglibach
  - Wendenwasser
  - Hasliaare
The idea of those four alpine rivers where the different types of morphology. Steinwasser and Wendenwasser are two alpine rivers with medium steepness. Giglibach is an apline torrent and Hasliaare as the prime site is a wide and shallow river, investigated in Innertkirchen.

## Data
The success of this project was joint with field work/data collection in the Grimsel and Susten area. The followed input parameters were necessary:
  - River crosssections, measured with DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System)
